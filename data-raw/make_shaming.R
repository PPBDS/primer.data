# See https://isps.yale.edu/research/data/d001 for lots of great details.
# Example:

# "Prior to random assignment we also removed households with the following
# characteristics: all members of the household had over a 60% probability of
# voting by absentee ballot if they voted or all household members had a greater
# than a 60% probability of choosing the Democratic primary rather than the
# Republican primary. Absentees were removed because it was thought that many
# would have decided to vote or not prior to receipt of the experimental
# mailings, which were sent to arrive just a few days before the election. Those
# considered overwhelmingly likely to favor the Democratic primary were excluded
# because it was thought that, given the lack of contested primaries, these
# citizens would tend to ignore pre election mailings. We removed everyone who
# lived in a route where fewer than 25 households remained, because the
# production process depended on using carrier-route-presort standard mail.
# Finally, we removed all those who had abstained in the 2004 general election
# on the grounds that those not voting in this very high turnout election were
# likely to be “deadwood”—those who had moved, died, or registered under more
# than one name."
