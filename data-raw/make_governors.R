# This dataset is from Barfort, Klemmensen & Larsen (2019), and was originally
# used in a paper published in Political Science and Research Methods. Details
# of the study can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2019.63, the raw
# data used here is available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IBKYRX.

# Reading in the data. I excluded variables that indicate a candidate's middle
# name ("cand_middle"), and  whether a candidate was living at the time the
# study was conducted ("living"). Neither variable provides meaningful insights,
# and excluding them keeps the dataset concise. Also, I excluded variables
# indicating annual increases in per capita income ("pc_inc_ann"), total
# expenditures ("tot_expenditure"), and life expectancy of a candidate in
# remaining years ("ex"). These variables may be interesting, but have way too
# many NAs to be useful. Finally, I excluded four variables indicating the the
# census region in which an election took place ("reg_south", "reg_west",
# "reg_midwest", "reg_northeast"). This adds little information, given that we
# already have a variable indicating the federal state in which an election took
# place.

# What is the `ex` variable? Looks interesting.

# Key variables are days lived before (living_day_imp_pre, living_day_pre) and
# after (living_day_imp_post, living_day_post) the election. Note that there are
# two versions of both, with one --- with "imp" in the name --- indicating that
# it has been imputed. They look highly similar, with a few less missing among
# the imputed. So, I will just use those, and out them into years rather than
# days for measurement.


# How accurate is this data? At random, I looked at Massachusetts and found two
# years (1908, 1909) with only one candidate (Republican Eben Draper). Yet,
# Wikipedia tells me that in 1908 and 1909 James H. Vahey ran against Draper.
# Indeed, in 1909, there was an Independence Party candidate, William Osgood,
# who got more than 5% of the vote. I have similar concerns about the 1854
# election in New York, where only 1 of the four candidates who got more than 5%
# of the vote is listed.  But there are (probably!) not enough omissions like
# this to change the results . . .

# Also, other data seems wrong. For example, David Williams, candidate for
# Governor in Kentucky in 2011 is listed with a death date of 2016-01-01, but
# Wikipedia lists him as alive. Other recent deaths check out. So, no worries?
