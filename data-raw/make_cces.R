# Script for cleaning cces data (Shiro 18). My intention here is to create two
# basic paths available for analysis. First, there's the basic analysis of whether
# different demographics have significantly different answers. Second, there's the
# analysis of approval of different levels of government official (pres, senator,
# governor).

# So, initially, I've kept most of the demographic information. Currently working
# on deciding which survey questions to keep. I discuss my choices below the
# select function.
