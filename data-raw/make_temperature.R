# This data contains monthly temperature deviations in Â°C from the respective
# average temperature in a region during 1991-2020. The data from before 1991
# initally used another reference time period, but values were re-calculated
# later on. Note: the variable us49 excludes Hawaii, apparently since "its land
# area is less than that of a satellite grid square, so it would have virtually
# no impact on the overall national results."

# Read in data for lower troposphere (last accessed Aug-04-21). Row number 513
# is where the garbage starts, hence the limit to 512 rows.
