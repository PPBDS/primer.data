# This data comes from the book crime by the numbers:
# https://github.com/jacobkap/crimebythenumbers/blob/master/data/shootings.csv
# It seems like the author originally took it from the FBIs Crime Data Explorer
# API, but I have not figured out how to use it yet. The data we have here is
# from 2015 to 2019, and it covers people who got shot by police officers. Not
# sure if we should include the names of the people who got shot, since it's
# somewhat irreverent, but also pretty interesting.
