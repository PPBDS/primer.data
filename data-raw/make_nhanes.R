# This dataset is from on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
# (NHANES), a program designed to assess the health status of adults and children
# in the United States. It is conducted yearly by a suborganization of the CDC,
# and involves both interviews and physical examinations of participants. The raw
# data can be accessed through their R package, details about the study can be
# found at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm.

# Loading the data and selecting the variables to be used. The dataset includes
# more than 70 variables, so there are many more potentially useful variables
# than we could possibly include. The ones below are some of the more well known
# measures that are relatively easy to interpret.

# Make use of this next time?

  # totally correct, but it eases further analyses while creating only minor
  # distortions (it's unlikely that people's health status changes a lot within
  # half a year).

  # Note that we could use 'HHIncomeMid' variable in the dataset, which uses the
  # median/mean of each group's range instead of the range itself. However,
  # unless peoples' incomes in each group follow a normal or equal distribution
  # that is centered around the mean/median of the respective range, this would
  # lead to distortions. For example, it makes little sense to assume that the
  # average income of all people in the group "75000-99999" is equal to this
  # ranges' median of 87500. Instead, we would expect much fewer observations at
  # the upper range, leading to a value that may not even be close to 87500. So,
  # the only change we make is to get rid of the annoying spaces in levels like
  # " 0-4999".

  # exact responses were offered by the researchers after asking people for
  # their general health conditions. This is pretty close to a question of the
