## About this package

`primer.data` provides the data used in *[Preceptor's Primer for Big Bayesian Data Science](https://ppbds.github.io/primer)*, the textbook used in [Gov 1005: Big Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005_spring_2021.html) at Harvard University, and for the [associated tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials).

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("ppbds/primer.data")
```

## Loading

After installing the package, it loads as any package should.

```{r loading, message=F}
library(tidyverse) 
library(primer.data)

qscores
```

## Using the data

Once the library is loaded and you have confirmed that it can be accessed in your local environment, the data sets can be called as objects and used like any other data you would otherwise read in and assign to an object manually. See the following example of a plot using `primary.data::qscores`.

<!-- DK: We need some comments explaining what this is doing and how we can replace it. Specifically, why place the figure in man/ rather than inst/? Why can't we just have this code run and save/show the image? Hate the eval=FALSE above. -->
