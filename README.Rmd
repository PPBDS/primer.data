## About this package

`primer.data` provides the data used in *[Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science](https://ppbds.github.io/primer)* and for the [associated tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials).

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("ppbds/primer.data")
```

## Loading

After installing the package, it loads as any package should.

```{r loading, message=F}
library(tidyverse) 
library(primer.data)

qscores
```

## Using the data

Once the library is loaded and you have confirmed that it can be accessed in your local environment, the data sets can be called as objects and used like any other data you would otherwise read in and assign to an object manually. See the following example of a plot using `primary.data::nobel`. 

```{r quick.plot, eval=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(primer.data)

nobel %>%
  group_by(born_country, year) %>%
  summarize(prizes = n()) %>%
  mutate(cum_prize = cumsum(prizes)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(born_country %in% c("USA", "United Kingdom", 
                             "Germany", "France", 
                             "Poland", "Sweden", 
                             "Japan")) %>%
  mutate(born_country = factor(born_country, levels = c("USA", "United Kingdom",
                                                        "Germany", "France", 
                                                        "Sweden", "Poland", 
                                                        "Japan"))) %>% 

ggplot(., aes(x = year, y = cum_prize, color = factor(born_country))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1945), color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1941, 
                y = 100, 
                label = "End of WW2"), 
                color = "darkgrey", 
                angle = 90, 
                vjust = 1.2,
                size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1900, 2020),  expand = expand_scale(0, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Nobel Prizes Over Time by Origin of Laureate",
       subtitle = "Number of U.S. laureates has grown at higher pace since 1945",
       y = "Prizes (Cumulative)",
       x = "Year",
       color = "Country") +
  theme_light()


```

<!-- TW: It is also possible to have this plot created by the code chunk itself. However, it is way to large and adjusting the dimensions causes errors. I don't know why. So for the time being, including a .png file is the better solution. -->
