 R CMD check and a home page for primer.tutorials. Hex sticker too!

* Pick a half dozen or more variables from CCES which are interesting/popular and add them.

- No need to transform variables.
- Find some numeric variables if you can.
- Use factors if the item has a natural ordering, and make sure the levels of the factor reflect that ordering.
- Leave as character if no natural ordering.

Especially interested in "All CCES surveys ask respondents whether they sup-port or oppose affirmative action policies, which are described as “programs [that] givepreference to racial minorities and to women in employment and college admissions inorder to correct for discrimination” (2008 CCES)."

Also:

"The first question, askedin the 2010 and 2011 CCES surveys, asks respondents on a five-point scale whether theyagree with the following statement: “The Irish, Italian, Jews and many other minoritiesovercame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same.” The secondquestion, asked in 2010, asks respondents, also on a five-point scale, whether they agreethat “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make itdifficult for Blacks to work their way out of the lower class.”

DK: I realize that, mostly, we have data which is always in the CCES, but these questions are important enough that I don't mind including them for just a few years. (And some of these may have continued on after they were first included.)

* Pick a half dozen or more variables from ANES for nes which are interesting/popular and add them. Start with:

"White-black thermometer difference.In many years, the ANES contains “feelingthermometer” questions, which ask respondents to evaluate their feelings about politi-cians and groups (including racial or ethnic groups) on a scale from 0 to 100."

* Create a cool plot for primer.data homepage using primer.data data set. Maybe republican vote by income. Or (better?) ideology by income.


* Are there more variables associated with the shaming data? There is so many observations that we could build a much richer model if we had more variables.

* Add the data for individual questions to the train data. That means adding a column for "question", with settings which include "overall". Or maybe we need two train data sets: the current one and trains_detailed?

* Learn about making test cases from [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html) and add at least one test case for each data set. (Be smart in making these. It is OK to have a test case which tests the number of rows in trains because trains will always have 115 rows. It would be bad (or maybe not?) to have a test case like that for cces since the number of rows for will change once we add next year's data to it.) The definition of a "careful tour" is that you have looked at make_* for a data set, regenerated it, and added at least two test cases about it. You should certainly use any current stopifnot() as test cases and then remove them from the make_* files.

* Transform all the make_ scripts into functions --- I think this is more professional --- which, by default, just return the data. There is an argument for installing them, but that is false by default.

* Provide instruction in the lower part of this document about the release cycle. Like, first you increment the number, then you update NEWS file, then . . . Or just a link to the instructions in R Packages.

* Called `nominate`. DW NOMINATE from VoteView project: https://www.voteview.com/data.


* Add gender column to qscores, created by using names, which will probably involve creating a first name column, which we will not keep.

* Should we re-create all the data sets each time we run R CMD package check? This would not take too much time and would ensure that everything is ship-shape.



* pkgdown

  - Start using a release and development branch?

  - Look for nice themes or yaml options

  - Nicer graphics on home page.

  - Instead, we could have an "Article" which provided a list of all the tibbles along with the one paragraph description. Then, the front page could just have a basic blurb and one nice graphic.


### Data Sets

* Science experiment: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6364/776/tab-figures-data

* Need something from MB's work on slavery. Ultimate use may just be in making an example for the maps appendix, which should be longer.

* Called `congress`. Something about the results of US congressional elections over several election cycles. 538? Really want this to include some measure of campaign spending so we can discuss a (potential) causal effect. Didn't they have a model which they used for the 2018 election? If they estimated a model, they must have some data.

* Called `police`. [Open police data](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/). Something with millions of rows and, ideally, geographic coordinates. We won't include this data in our repo. Instead, the make_police.R script will download and process it. Ideally, we can get the final police.rda to be less than 100 meg so that we don't need to turn on git-lfs again.


### Instructions

* Write scripts which create our data sets and adds them to our primer.data package. Write associated help files. Skim [*R Packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/), but read closely the [data section](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html). Examine [covdata package](https://kjhealy.github.io/covdata/). Use **usethis** and **pkgdown** packages.

* Follow the conventions with the trains data: make_trains.R (in data-raw/), trains.rda (in data/), trains.R (in R/). Note that the name of the tibble -- "trains" -- appears in the file name of each of the three key things you are creating. We also call the article which is associated with the data, and placed in inst/papers, "trains.pdf".

* Main workflow is that raw data is placed in the data-raw/ directory. It is read and cleaned in the make_name-of-tibble.R script, the last step of which is to create the name-of-tibble.rda file, using `usethis::use_data(name-of-tibble, overwrite = TRUE)`. The make_name-of-tibble.R has lots and lots of documentation, including the details of where the original data came from, and instructions on how to download it, if necessary. (At some point, we might turn this into a function, as Healy does, but not right now.) name-of-tibble.R provides the information for R to create the help file. It includes at least two paragraphs of background on the data source itself, ideally to include a key academic paper.

* Think hard about variable type. No ordered factors. If something has no natural ordering, make it character. If it does have an ordering, make it a factor and give the levels the ordering you want.  Document your reasoning in your make_name-of-tibble.R script. Examine the choices made in make_trains.R.


### pkgdown

* We are currently using pkgdown to make our website. But it is confusing and a bit fragile. Nor have I done a good job of documenting my lessons. Start [here](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html). I had to run `usethis::use_pkgdown()` once, and then do some fussing to get the automated push stuff to work. Even though I only did this a few weeks ago, I have already forgotten the key steps. Weak! Document better!

* You need to use `pkgdown::build_site()` to create the site after you have made some changes.

* Need to make the home page nicer. Follow [these instructions](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_home.html).


### Package Versions

This section provides an overview of how to name package versions (see also https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#release-version). The development state of each package has a unique numbering such as "Version 1.2.3.9000". The version name usually consists of three or four digits, each of which stands for a specific type of change:

* "Major releases” are indicated by the first digit, or “1” in our example above. This number is incremented if we make changes to the package that are not backward compatible and may affect many people. An example would be if we delete an entire dataset or remove variables from an existing dataset. In other words, things that cause major problems in someone's code who is already using our package - try to avoid such changes whenever possible!

* "Minor releases” are indicated by the second digit, or “2” in our example. This number is incremented when we make bug fixes, add new features or make backward-compatible changes. This is the most common type of change, for instance when we add new datasets.

* "Patches” are indicated by the third digit, or “3” in our example. This number is incremented if we fix bugs without adding relevant new features, e.g. when making changes to help files.

* In-development packages, i.e. packages which are not yet released on CRAN (like ours), also have a fourth digit. The default value is usually set to 9000, as in the example above. This number is only incremented when we add important features that another in-development package should depend on. Since this is unlikely to be the case, we can leave the fourth digit at 9000 as long as PPBDS.data has not been published on CRAN (from then on only the first three digits will be used).

* No other digit, but a legitimate question is also: When do we change from 0.a.b to 1.0.0? The first digit should be set from 0 to 1 when our package is "feature complete". This could be the case if our package contains all necessary datasets a student needs in GOV 50. It could also mean that the package is in a state to be realeased on CRAN (or both). In the end, it's up to us to answer this question. Furthermore, note that as long as the first digit is still 0, non-backward compatible changes will be recorded by incrementing the second digit (and not the first, as described above).

Once we have made some changes and agreed on a proper name for the new version, we need to change the old name. First, we have to open the DESCRIPTION file and manually enter the correct version. Save the changes and run build_site() in the console. The new name of the version should now show on top of the homepage. Next, update the changelog which is generated by the NEWS.md file. Simply open the file and orientate yourself on the existing content to add a new entry. If everything looks right, save the changes and use build_site() again to see the result. While there is no rule on this, most packages mention the fourth digit only in the DESCRIPTION file and not in NEWS.md. (I follow this convention as well). Whenever new changes are made, simply repeat the described process.


### Github Pages

Github allows you to create web pages with a username.github.io/repo URL. As an example, the website for this package is accessible at ppbds.github.io/primer.data. (Our "user" here is an organisation called PPBDS).

Creating a page with Github Pages is easy, and it can be done for any repo. First go to a repo on Github. Go to the Settings and scroll down to the "Github Pages" section. Click on the button that says "None" and select a branch. The selected branch will later be searched for files to build the website, and in most cases you will want to select the "main" branch. Optionally, you can then select a folder within that repository. The options are either /(root), which is simply the root directory, or /docs, where Github will look for a folder called "docs" within the selected repo. If you don't already have a "docs" folder, just stick with /(root). Once you have selected a branch and folder, press the "Save" button. You should then see a grey bar in the Github Pages section with the message "Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/repo". This means that the site has not yet been published. Wait a few minutes, refresh the page, and check again. The bar should now be green with the message "Your site is published at https://username.github.io". The page can now be accessed by anyone. Once we change files in the repo that affect the web page's appearance, Github Pages automatically updates the page. Until the page has been updated, which can indeed take some time, the settings will again show a grey bar with "Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/repo" again. Once the bar turns green, the website will show the new version.


How do I build a site? Ran library(pkgdown) and issued what commands? Or at least I link to the page: https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/

Run

usethis::use_pkgdown()
