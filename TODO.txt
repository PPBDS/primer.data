* remove.packages(PPBDS.data) -- [Done]

* usethis 2.0 -- [Done]

* use pkgdown, add back homepage (document how we did this!) -- [Done]

* Github actions and workflow (do this with usethis helper functions)
    automatic (?) homepage
    automatic R CMD check with pull requests

* Update cces with 2020 data

* Several of the data sets, especially CCES and NES, should have many more variables in them. Pick a dozen or more which are interesting/popular and add them. (Are there some numeric variables.)

* Clean up `sps`. Which variables do we need? What do they show? What should they be called?





* Clean up governors. Maybe change alive_pre to age (in years)? Then change alive_post to what? Maybe years_ahead or years_to_live or years_left?

* Are there more variables associated with the shaming data? There is so much data that we could build a much richer model.

* article section. Have a directory in which copies of the key articles are distributed. Add inst/papers with all the relevant papers. Then link from the help pages to these locations?

* Learn about making test cases from [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html) and add at least one test case for each data set. (Be smart in making these. It is OK to have a test case which tests the number of rows in trains because trains will always have 115 rows. It would be bad (or maybe not?) to have a test case like that for cces since the number of rows for will change once we add next year's data to it.) The definition of a "careful tour" is that you have looked at make_* for a data set, regenerated it, and added at least two test cases about it. You should certainly use any current stopifnot() as test cases and then remove them from the make_* files.

## Previous

Is there an issue about having library(NHANES) and such in our make_* scripts causing warnings when students just want to library(primer.data)? Maybe this would go away if we changed these make_* files from scripts to functions? We certainly do not want to require anyone who installs this package to have these libraries. That is too much, especially since we will have lots of students installing this package so they can do the tutorial. Maybe having all of these as Suggests solves this problem in exactly the way that it should be solved.

Provide instruction in the lower part of this document about the release cycle. Like, first you increment the number, then you update NEWS file, then . . . Or just a link to the instructions in R Packages.

* Called `nominate`. DW NOMINATE from VoteView project: https://www.voteview.com/data.






## Other

* Add gender column to qscores, created by using names, which will probably involve creating a first name column, which we will not keep.

* Should we re-create all the data sets each time we run R CMD package check? This would not take too much time and would ensure that everything is ship-shape.



* pkgdown

  - Start using a release and development branch?

  - Look for nice themes or yaml options

  - Nicer graphics on home page.

  - Instead, we could have an "Article" which provided a list of all the tibbles along with the one paragraph description. Then, the front page could just have a basic blurb and one nice graphic.

  - Would it be useful to have another Article? Perhaps a guide to which data sets go well with which portions of the textbook?


### Data Sets

* Science experiment: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6364/776/tab-figures-data

* Need something from MB's work on slavery. Ultimate use may just be in making an example for the maps appendix, which should be longer.

* Called `congress`. Something about the results of US congressional elections over several election cycles. 538? Really want this to include some measure of campaign spending so we can discuss a (potential) causal effect. Didn't they have a model which they used for the 2018 election? If they estimated a model, they must have some data.

* Called `police`. [Open police data](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/). Something with millions of rows and, ideally, geographic coordinates. We won't include this data in our repo. Instead, the make_police.R script will download and process it. Ideally, we can get the final police.rda to be less than 100 meg so that we don't need to turn on git-lfs again.

* Maybe [GSS](http://gss.norc.org/). Isn't there already an R package? https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/. Could issue a PR for changing the installation instructions to use remotes:: instead of devtools.

* FEC data. This is complex and important enough that it might become a stand-alone package. See [DIME](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/O5PX0B&version=2.2).

* Shiro: I also have a clean large dataset of satellite lights in Africa from this period using this paper: https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20161385

* Called `deaths`. Maybe that demography data we used on the last day of 1005 this semester? Or is that too big?


### Instructions

* Write scripts which create our data sets and adds them to our primer.data package. Write associated help files. Skim [*R Packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/), but read closely the [data section](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html). Examine [covdata package](https://kjhealy.github.io/covdata/). Use **usethis** and **pkgdown** packages.

* Follow the conventions with the trains data: make_trains.R (in data-raw/), trains.rda (in data/), trains.R (in R/). Note that the name of the tibble -- "trains" -- appears in the file name of each of the three key things you are creating.

* Main workflow is that raw data is placed in the data-raw/ directory. It is read and cleaned in the make_name-of-tibble.R script, the last step of which is to create the name-of-tibble.rda file, using `usethis::use_data(name-of-tibble, overwrite = TRUE)`. The make_name-of-tibble.R has lots and lots of documentation, including the details of where the original data came from, and instructions on how to download it, if necessary. (At some point, we might turn this into a function, as Healy does, but not right now.) name-of-tibble.R provides the information for R to create the help file. It includes at least two paragraphs of background on the data source itself, ideally to include a key academic paper.

* Think hard about variable type. Don't make something a factor unless you have a reason to. If something has a natural order, then perhaps it should be an ordered factor. Document your reasoning in your make_name-of-tibble.R script. Examine the choices made in make_trains.R.


### pkgdown

* We are currently using pkgdown to make our website. But it is confusing and a bit fragile. Nor have I done a good job of documenting my lessons. Start [here](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html). I had to run `usethis::use_pkgdown()` once, and then do some fussing to get the automated push stuff to work. Even though I only did this a few weeks ago, I have already forgotten the key steps. Weak! Document better!

* You need to use `pkgdown::build_site()` to create the site after you have made some changes.

* Need to make the home page nicer. Follow [these instructions](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_home.html).


### Package Versions

This section provides an overview of how to name package versions (see also https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#release-version). The development state of each package has a unique numbering such as "Version 1.2.3.9000". The version name usually consists of three or four digits, each of which stands for a specific type of change:

* "Major releases” are indicated by the first digit, or “1” in our example above. This number is incremented if we make changes to the package that are not backward compatible and may affect many people. An example would be if we delete an entire dataset or remove variables from an existing dataset. In other words, things that cause major problems in someone's code who is already using our package - try to avoid such changes whenever possible!

* "Minor releases” are indicated by the second digit, or “2” in our example. This number is incremented when we make bug fixes, add new features or make backward-compatible changes. This is the most common type of change, for instance when we add new datasets.

* "Patches” are indicated by the third digit, or “3” in our example. This number is incremented if we fix bugs without adding relevant new features, e.g. when making changes to help files.

* In-development packages, i.e. packages which are not yet released on CRAN (like ours), also have a fourth digit. The default value is usually set to 9000, as in the example above. This number is only incremented when we add important features that another in-development package should depend on. Since this is unlikely to be the case, we can leave the fourth digit at 9000 as long as PPBDS.data has not been published on CRAN (from then on only the first three digits will be used).

* No other digit, but a legitimate question is also: When do we change from 0.a.b to 1.0.0? The first digit should be set from 0 to 1 when our package is "feature complete". This could be the case if our package contains all necessary datasets a student needs in GOV 50. It could also mean that the package is in a state to be realeased on CRAN (or both). In the end, it's up to us to answer this question. Furthermore, note that as long as the first digit is still 0, non-backward compatible changes will be recorded by incrementing the second digit (and not the first, as described above).

Once we have made some changes and agreed on a proper name for the new version, we need to change the old name. First, we have to open the DESCRIPTION file and manually enter the correct version. Save the changes and run build_site() in the console. The new name of the version should now show on top of the homepage. Next, update the changelog which is generated by the NEWS.md file. Simply open the file and orientate yourself on the existing content to add a new entry. If everything looks right, save the changes and use build_site() again to see the result. While there is no rule on this, most packages mention the fourth digit only in the DESCRIPTION file and not in NEWS.md. (I follow this convention as well). Whenever new changes are made, simply repeat the described process.


### Github Pages

Github allows you to create web pages with a username.github.io/repo URL. As an example, the website for this package is accessible at ppbds.github.io/primer.data. (Our "user" here is an organisation called PPBDS).

Creating a page with Github Pages is easy, and it can be done for any repo. First go to a repo on Github. Go to the settings and scroll down to the "Github Pages" section. Click on the button that says "None" and select a branch. The selected branch will later be searched for files to build the website, and in most cases you will want to select the "main" branch. Optionally, you can then select a folder within that repository. The options are either /(root), which is simply the root directory, or /docs, where Github will look for a folder called "docs" within the selected repo. If you don't already have a "docs" folder, just stick with /(root). Once you have selected a branch and folder, press the "Save" button. You should then see a grey bar in the Github Pages section with the message "Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/repo". This means that the site has not yet been published. Wait a few minutes, refresh the page, and check again. The bar should now be green with the message "Your site is published at https://username.github.io". The page can now be accessed by anyone. Once we change files in the repo that affect the web page's appearance, Github Pages automatically updates the page. Until the page has been updated, which can indeed take some time, the settings will again show a grey bar with "Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/repo" again. Once the bar turns green, the website will show the new version.
