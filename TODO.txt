### Improvements

* Revisit governors so that it includes all the data. Chapter which uses it must then delete the pre-1945 data.

* Update cces

* Drop some data, like names.csv, which we no longer use for the class.

* Add some data for class examples, like resume.csv

* Revisit the connectedness data.
  - We have copies of the NYT article in the bootcamp repo. Where should we keep that so that students have easy access?
  - Would be nice to add income data so that we can reproduce some of the scatter plots from that article.
  - Might be nice to add some other variables. Even other versions of connectedness would allow us to test the robustness of our main finding.


* Look at: https://upworthy.natematias.com/. Pick one data set which you think is cool. Add it to the package. Think about stuff which might be valuable in the chapters, obviously.


* Consider deleting unused data

* Add the data for individual questions to the train data. That means adding a column for "question", with settings which include "overall". Or maybe we need two train data sets: the current one and trains_detailed?

* Learn about making test cases from [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html) and add at least one test case for each data set. (Be smart in making these. It is OK to have a test case which tests the number of rows in trains because trains will always (?) have 115 rows. It would be bad (or maybe not?) to have a test case like that for cces since the number of rows for will change once we add next year's data to it.) The definition of a "careful tour" is that you have looked at make_* for a data set, regenerated it, and added at least two test cases about it. You should certainly use any current stopifnot() as test cases and then remove them from the make_* files.

* Transform all the make_ scripts into functions --- I think this is more professional --- which, by default, just return the data. There is an argument for having these functions also install the new data in the package, but the valaue of that argument  is false by default.

* Should we re-create all the data sets each time we run R CMD package check? This would not take too much time and would ensure that everything is ship-shape.

* pkgdown

  - Look for nice themes or yaml options

  - Nicer graphics on home page.

  - Instead, we could have an "Article" which provided a list of all the tibbles along with the one paragraph description. Then, the front page could just have a basic blurb and one nice graphic.

* Create better stickers with hexSticker package.


### Data Sets

* Need some business data sets, especially ones with real randomized testing. Maybe A/B testing of some sort.

* Non-political science data:

 - NYC taxi and limousine trip records (https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/)
 - College major & income (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-10-16)
 - Science experiment: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6364/776/tab-figures-data
 - Called `police`. [Open police data](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/). Something with millions of rows and, ideally, geographic coordinates. We won't include this data in our repo. Instead, the make_police.R script will download and process it. Ideally, we can get the final police.rda to be less than 100 meg so that we don't need to turn on git-lfs again.
