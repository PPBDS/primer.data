This data is from a paper entitled \href{Results from a 2020 field experiment
encouraging voting by
mail}{https://github.com/PPBDS/primer.data/blob/master/inst/papers/mail.pdf}.
See also the 'Details' section below. The aim of the study was to understand
how facilitating mail ballot requests affects their use. A total of over
935,000 registered voters in Philadelphia were randomly assigned to either a
control group or one of two treatment groups. The results combine information
on voting behavior with voter's demographic background.

\details{
Pennsylvania's primary election took place on 2 June, 2020. Two weeks before
the election, on 18 May 2020, a group of randomly selected registrants in
Philadelphia received postcards with information about applying to vote by
mail. This was the first statewide federal election held since Pennsylvania
adopted universal access to mail ballots, so information about how to apply
was particularly likely to increase awareness of voting by mail.

Registrants were sent one of two postcards about mail ballots or no postcard.
The postcards conveyed information about the 26 May deadline to request a
mail ballot and included a message either encouraging voters to request a
ballot because “it’s safer for you to vote by mail!” or “it’s safer for
neighborhood to vote by mail!”. In all, 23,475 registered voters were
assigned to the “self” condition and 23,485 to the “neighborhood” condition,
with the remaining 888,785 in the control condition receiving no postcard.
