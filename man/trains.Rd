\description{
Data for attitudes toward immigration-related policies, both before and after
an experiment which randomly exposed a treated group to Spanish-speakers on a
Boston commuter train platform. See Enos (2014)
for background and details (\href{https://github.com/PPBDS/primer.data/blob/master/inst/papers/trains.pdf}{pdf}).
Individuals with a treatment value of "Treated" were exposed to two
Spanish-speakers on their regular commute. "Control" individuals were not.
