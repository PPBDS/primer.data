\details{
The 2018 Florida Senate election was one of the most closely contested and
significant races in the country, as it was considered key to determining
control of the U.S. Senate. The race featured incumbent Democratic Senator
Bill Nelson, who was seeking his fourth term, against Republican Governor
Rick Scott, who was term-limited as governor. The election was extremely
close, with initial results showing a margin of less than 0.25 percentage
points, which triggered both machine and hand recounts under Florida law.
After nearly two weeks of recounting and legal challenges, Rick Scott
ultimately won with a final margin of 10,033 votes out of more than 8
million votes cast. Nelson conceded the race on November 18, 2018, ending
his 18-year Senate career and giving Republicans a crucial pickup in their
efforts to maintain Senate control.

The original data file was "elections-poll-flsen-3.csv" and has been
processed to rename variables for consistency and select relevant columns
for analysis.
