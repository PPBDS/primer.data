\title{Michigan voting experiment with social shaming}
\format{
A tibble with 344,084 observations and 15 variables:
\describe{
\item{cluster}{character variable with cluster designation, which ranges from 1 to 10,000. See
the documentation for extensive discussion about the clustering procedure}
\item{primary_06}{0/1 integer variable indicating whether the respondent voted in the 2006 primary election}
\item{treatment}{factor variable indicating which of the 5 treatments was employed in 2006, but
before the primary election that year: 'Control', 'Civic Duty', 'Hawthorne',
'Self', or 'Neighbors'}
\item{sex}{character variable with values "Male" and "Female"}
\item{age}{integer variable indicating the respondent's age in 2006}
\item{primary_00}{character variable indicating whether the respondent voted in the 2000 primary election}
\item{general_00}{character variable indicating whether the respondent voted in the 2000 general election}
\item{primary_02}{character variable indicating whether the respondent voted in the 2002 primary election}
\item{general_02}{character variable indicating whether the respondent voted in the 2002 general election}
\item{primary_04}{character variable indicating whether the respondent voted in the 2004 primary election}
\item{general_04}{character variable indicating whether the respondent voted in the 2004 general election}
\item{hh_size}{integer variable indicating the respondent's household size}
\item{hh_primary_04}{numeric variable indicating the percent of household members who
voted in the 2004 primary election. This and hh_general_04 seem
suspicious}
\item{hh_general_04}{numeric variable indicating the percent of household members who
voted in the 2004 general election. Most be greater than zero since, in order to
be included in the sample, a respondent must have voted in that election}
\item{neighbors}{integer variable indicating the number of neighbors. This is, presumably, most relevant if the
respondent was in the "Neighbors" group. neighbors is, in that case, the number of names
listed on the mailing. Large majority of values is 21, which is the maximum
number of names which could be printed on the mailing}

\description{
This is a data set corresponding to the paper "Social Pressure and Voter
Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment" by
\href{https://doi.org/10.1017/S000305540808009X}{Gerber, Green, and Larimer
(2008)}. See also the 'Details' section below. The aim of the study was to
find out whether and to what extent people are motivated to vote by social
pressure. To answer this question, the authors conducted a field experiment
prior to the August 2006 primary election in Michigan. A total of 180,000
households were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of four
treatment groups.
}
\details{
The control group consisted of approximately 100,000 households and was observed
without further intervention.The treatment groups consisted of about 20,000 households
each, and were sent one mailing 11 days prior to the primary election. The first
treatment group, named “Civic Duty”, received a letter that only reminded them to
"do their civic duty and vote". The second treatment group, named "Hawthorne",
received the same message with an additional notice that they are being studied by
researchers. The letter sent to the third group, named "Self", included the content
in the Hawthorne letter, but added a notice that every household member would be
notified of each others' voting behavior after the election (this information is
public). The last group, "Neighbors", finally listed not only the household's voting
records but also the voting records of those nearby. As in the "Self" group, everyone
on the list would be notified of their voting behavior after the primary.
